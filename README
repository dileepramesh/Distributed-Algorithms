This submission includes the code for the following 2 algorithms:

1. Ricart-Agrawala's token-based algorithm
2. Suzuki-Kasami's token-based algorithm

The following files have been included:

1. RAtoken.py - Implements Ricart-Agrawala's token based algorithm
2. SKtoken.py - Implements Suzuki-Kasami's token based algorithm
3. RAtoken.log - Contains sample output from running algorithm (3)
4. SKtoken.log - Contains sample output from running algorithm (4)

How to run the programs
-----------------------

Algorithm (1)
    "python3.2 -m distalgo.runtime --logfile RAtoken.log RAtoken.dis 10 200"

Algorithm (2)
    "python3.2 -m distalgo.runtime --logfile SKtoken.log SKtoken.dis 10 200"

Algorithm Description
---------------------

 - RAtoken.dis and SKtoken.dis files contains the following functions:
   - Global main() method
     - Gets the 'n' and 'm' parameters from the user and calls setup() routine for each process
     - Starts the processes
   - RAtoken Class
     - setup(): Takes the list of processes, request count for the process and
                assigns token to the process based on a passed flag
     - cs(): Contains the CS request, entry and exit code blocks. Also
             contains code blocks to handle requests from other processes
     - main(): Contains the CS task that is passed to cs(). This will loop 
               through the list of requests and call cs() till all the requests 
               are exhausted.
